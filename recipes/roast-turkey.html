    <h2>A Simply Perfect Roast Turkey</h2>

    <p>
      Simply roast turkey just like grandma used to make. Seasoned with salt and
      pepper and basted with turkey stock, the flavors of the turkey really
      stand out. Stuff with your favorite dressing.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Turkey</li>
      <li>Stuffing</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
      <li>Turkey Stock</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Remove the turkey neck and giblets. Pat the turkey dry with paper
        towels, then place it (breast-side up) on a rack in a roasting pan.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Fill the cavity with stuffing. Rub the skin with butter, then season
        with salt and pepper. Pour two cups of stock into the roasting pan and
        loosely tent the turkey with foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast, basting with stock every 30 minutes, for about two and half
        hours. Add more stock as the drippings evaporate. Remove the foil and
        continue roasting until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest
        part of the thigh reads 165 degrees F.
